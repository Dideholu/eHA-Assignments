    <h1>My Perfect Trip Destination</h1>
    <p>My Perfect trip destination will be <strong><em>South Korea.</em></strong> For many travelers, <strong>South Korea</strong> a seamless fusion of <em>old and new</em> —a place where history lives beside cutting-edge innovation,<br>
      where bustling cities give way to tranquil islands, and where every meal feels like an experience of its own.</em></strong></p>

      <h2>Jeju Island</h2>
      <p>I look forward to visiting the famous <strong>Jeju Island</strong>.
  <br>Indeed, Jeju is officially recognised by <strong>UNESCO</strong> as a World Natural Heritage Site, Global Geopark and Biosphere Reserve,<br>
      encompassing Korea's <em>highest</em> peak of Hallasan Mountain, the vast forested swathes of a semi-tropical national park,<br>
      a wild coastline and the <strong>world's longest underground lava tube</strong>.</p><br>

      <h3> Animals in Korea</h3>
      <p>I would really love to see some traditional animals exclusive to Korea.<br>
        On top of my lists is the<stong> Mandarin Duck.</stong></p>

      <h4>Food</h4>
      <p>Korean cuisine is a rich tapestry of bold flavors, vibrant colors, and deep-rooted traditions.<br>
      Known for its emphasis on balance—spicy, sweet, salty, sour, and bitter flavors all play a role.<br>
      Korean food celebrates seasonal ingredients and harmony.<br>
      Signature dishes include bibimbap (rice with mixed vegetables and meat), bulgogi (marinated grilled beef), and samgyeopsal (grilled pork belly).<br>
      Korean street food is equally beloved, with favorites like tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), hotteok (sweet pancakes), and kimbap (rice rolls) found in bustling markets.</p>
