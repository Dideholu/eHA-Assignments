    <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
    <p1>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
        And sorry <strong>I</strong> could not travel both <br>
        And be one traveler, long as <strong>I</strong> stood<br>
        And looked down one as far as <Strong>I</Strong> could<br> 
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
        <br>
        Then took the other, as just as fair,<br> 
        And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
        Though as for that the passing there<br>
        Had worn them really about the same,<br>
        <br>
        And both that morning equally lay<br> 
        In leaves no step had trodden black.<br> 
        Oh, <strong>I</strong> kept the first for another day!<br> 
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
        <strong>I</strong> doubted if <strong>I</strong> should ever come back.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>I</strong> shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and <strong>I</strong>,<br>
        <strong><em>I</em> took the one less travelled by,</strong><br>
        <em>And that has made all the difference.</em>
